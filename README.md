# AccuracyReserveHGLM
This repository contains the code, which gives the results of the numerical example in the paper:
"Bootstrap measures of prediction accuracy of loss reserves in a non-life insurance company", wolny-Dominiak A., Zadlo T.
In HGLM loss reserving an alternative to the analytical approach is to use the bootstrap technique. The main purpose of this paper is to propose the full residual and parametric bootstrap procedures for the estimation of three types of prediction accuracy measures. The first is a classic root mean squared error of prediction (RMSE). The second is a quantile of the absolute prediction error (QAPE). The third one, we propose, is a quantile of a mixture of absolute prediction errors. Stochastic properties of the estimators of the accuracy measures are studied in two Monte Carlo simulation experiments.
